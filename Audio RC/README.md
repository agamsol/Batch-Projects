### ‚öô Usage
#### üó£ Using TTS (Text to speech)
- **TTS Tested Languages: English**
- **TTS has 2 Avilable voices : David or Zira**
- **TTS Volume Ranging is from 1 to 100**

To use TTS we need to change a few settings,

Lets say we want the computer to say `Hello, How are you`




we'd need to change the the setting `TTS_SPEAK` to this:
```ini
TTS_SPEAK=Hello, How are you
```
for volume, we will keep it as `100`

```ini
TTS_VOLUME=100
```

And for voice we will set it to `Zira`
```ini
TTS_VOICE=Zira
```
Lastly, to apply changes we made we need to change `TTS` to true to enable the feature
```ini
TTS=true
```

#### üîó Using Youtube
- **Youtube link to a Video**
- **‚ö† Providing a link to a playlist will only play the first song in the playlist**

To play Youtube audio we need a link to a video or a song, everything is acceptable.

For this showcase we will choose the song `See You Again`.

The link for it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk

Under `YOUTUBE_URI` we want to paste the URL of the video
```ini
YOUTUBE_URI=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk
```

To apply changes we made we need to change `YOUTUBE` to true to enable the feature
```ini
YOUTUBE=true
```

###### **‚ö† Dont forget to save the changes you made, click the green save button**

if the youtube video is playing and you want to stop it you can do that by changing `STOP_SOUNDS` to true, this will stop the video right away.
```ini
STOP_SOUNDS=true
```
